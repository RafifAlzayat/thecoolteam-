## Machine Learning Models

  Because all of our data is either ordinal or classificatin data we will have to change our data into numbers via dummy variables. We can use the following models and see which model like best or which models are better for visualizing different conclusions:
  
  * Linear Least Squares
  * Ridge Regression
  * Lasso
  * Multinomial Logistic Regression
  * Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient-Boosted Tree (GBT)
  * One vs. Rest
  * Naive Bayes
  * Factorization Machine Classifier

  We will create each one of these models with our COVID-19 data, and tweak the parameters to test for under fitting or over fitting, to figure out which models and at what parameters are best for visualizing certain conclusions about the data. All of our models will be supervized machine learning models.
  
  We can use SVMs, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosted trees, and naive Bayes models to solve binary problems like who is likely to contract COVID-19. We can use decision trees, random forest, and naive Bayes multiclass classification problems. We can use decision trees, random forest, linear least squares, ridge regression, Lasso, multinomial logistic regression, and GBT to visualize regressions.
  
### From Ava: A logistic regression model is a classification model, so I think we would be able to use it. We just need to change our data into numbers   via dummy variables, just like with the rest of the models.
