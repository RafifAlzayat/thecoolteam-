# Covid Analysis
## Data Topic and Overview
### Our team has chosen to analyze covid data from the CDC. We selected this data due to its relevancy as well as availability. The data has approximately 26 million rows, with each row being a unique individual that has been tested for covid. It includes the individuals age, race, ethnicity, hospitalization status, state, etc. We'd like to analyze and figure out which factor in the data contributes the most to an individual being hospitalized.
